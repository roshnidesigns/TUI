/*
* Social Battery — full sketch, 18 September
* Tangible User Interface class - CIID
*
* Everything on one board: two servo arms and the motorized fader, each with its
* own pins and its own loop. Neither drives the other; they share only the board
* and the serial port.
*
*   ARMS      two servos, D2 and D3, driven from the web page over USB serial.
*             Each has its own level; a level sets how wide and how fast the arm
*             ping-pongs about its resting angle. Nothing moves until a level is
*             chosen, and a stopped arm releases rather than holding torque.
*
*   FADER     a 100mm motorized fader on D4/D5 with its wiper on A1 and an
*             8-pixel NeoPixel strip on D1. Move it by hand and it captures the
*             gesture; let go and it mirrors your position and ping-pongs between
*             the two. Where you leave it picks the level, measured as equal
*             quarters either side of the centre of travel.
*
* Pins
*   D1   NeoPixel data          D4/D5  HW-354 IN1 / IN2

//
// Holding torque at idle keeps the arm rigidly on CENTER_ANGLE, which is what the
// object's "vertical at rest" look depends on — but it means a stopped servo is
// pushing continuously, and if the arm is fighting anything mechanical that is a
// permanent stall: full current, no movement, all of it heat. A servo that gets hot
// while doing nothing is telling you it cannot reach where it is being sent.

// D13/D14, not here, so there is no UART conflict to worry about.
